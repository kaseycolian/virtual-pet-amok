Welcome to The Lair!

We specialize in inclusivity, no matter your genees (or lack thereof), you are welcome here!

We currently are home to dragons, many phoenix, and most recently robodragons!  We understand that creature needs are very unique and nobody will begin their stay in the same condition.

We want you to be healthy, happy, and oiled, and those are the only levels around here that we want high!

We'll take care of your other needs by keeping them low.  Our creatures have many needs, which all effect each other.  Our goal is to keep you low in these areas:

*Hunger Level
*Thirst Level
*Magic Level
*Boredom Level
*Belly Fullness Level



The game operates on a continuous loop. Each time the user interacts with the main menu, the tick effect is applied that increases each levels of all creatures. The game will end when the user opts to end the game through the system menu.
